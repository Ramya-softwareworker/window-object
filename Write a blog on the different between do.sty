Write a blog on the different between document and window object
                                          There seems to be a let of misconceptions on the difference between the document and  window object for javascript.
         WINDOW object and DOCUMENT  object  ARE NOT THIS SAME !!!!!!
         I have set out to clarify this for you in the most visual manor as possible.
        So, what is the difference between  the document  object and window object you ask?  Good question.

	        {document}
	                         HTML                                                            
	OR.  ASPX.  Php
	         </>
	Document gets loaded
	     Info window obect
	                              =
                                                           Window.  document .  {property}




Javascript Widow Object With Document Loaded
Well, the window is the first things that gets loaded into the browser.  This window object has the majority of the properties like length, innerHeight, name, if it has been closed, its parents, and more.  
What about the document object then?
The document objet is your html, aspx, php, or other documents that will be loaded into the browser.  The document actually gets loaded inside the window obect and hs properties available to it like title, URL, cookie, etc.  What dose this really mean?  That means if you want to access a property for  the window it is window.  Property, if it is document it is window.  Docuent.  Property which is also available in short as document property.
That seen simle enough.  But what happens once an IFRAME is introduced ?  Uh oh…. Frameage.  An iframe actually is considered  as a new window with its own document loaded into it.  Here is where it may seen a little odd, but dose make sense if you think about it.  The original, parent window, is responsible for other windows to be loaded, not the document.
